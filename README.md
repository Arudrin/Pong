    Classic Pong
         Everytime a racquet hits the ball, it bounces according to the code.
         The ball increases its speed up to a certain limit everytime a racquet hits it.
         The goal is to reach 3 points.
         To score you need to get the ball past the other racquet and touch the base.
        
    ERRORS: 
        The Lower Racquet's scoring also adds to the upper racquet.
